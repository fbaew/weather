# weather

Build a toolkit of weather scripts for retrieving eg
- radar images
- satellite images
- forecasts
- current and historical conditions

Eventually, we will have some kind of web frontend to show us all the pretty pictures.

Currently, we have
ImageAggregator.py. Should provide some basic usage examples here once at v0.1

Makes use of the great datetime library.

Imagemagick might help for gif generation:
convert radar_img/* radar.gif
