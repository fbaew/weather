-time zone considerations - just do everything in UTC...

Store filenames in established pattern, radar default format of 2015_07_29_17_40 OK?

Figure out all services and url patterns we want.

have list of stations in script, maybe s=Satllite(ImageAggregator) takes an arg string of "XSM" and sets up s.url, etc.

Have to keep an eye out for any url patterns that aren't rounded to clean 10 minute intervals.

dateRange(self, fromTime,toTime=datetime.datetime.utcnow(),minuteInterval=10) should make this it's own class and decompose
into a couple different functions.

Work is needed on function names, better OO
